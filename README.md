I'm a  Freelance Software Engineer experienced in developing, operating, troubleshooting and scaling large scale distributed systems,
such as data infrastructure, search systems and high-traffic backend services. 

I'm passionate about NixOS, Open-Source and system reliability and correctness, but equally about happy and effective teams.

Aside from that, I'm a passionate cook and home-made kimchi maker, mountain-biker and endurance cyclist.
